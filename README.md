## Description

`Okaeli_CategoryCode` is a Magento速 2 extension that will add a "code" attribute to categories.

The main purpose of this is to have a unique identifier to manage categories (better than `id` that could be dependent on the environment).

In addition, this extension can add a new handle in the category page layout depending on this unique identifier. This should be used to put the design of a 
specific category in your Version Control System tool (e.g by modifying a xml file) instead of doing that in the `Layout Update XML` backend field. 


## Installation

### Requirements

- Magento >= 2.3 

Before 2.3, the data patch method was not used to create an attribute, so the `okaeli_category_code` attribute should be
created with the old method.

### Installation methods

The preferred way of installing `okaeli/magento2-category-code` is through Composer. Simply add `okaeli/magento2-category-code` as a dependency:

    composer.phar require okaeli/magento2-category-code

Optionally you can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/julienloizelet/magento2-category-code/releases) and install the decompressed code in your projects directory under `app/code/Okaeli/CategoryCode`.

## Post Installation

### Enable the module

After the installment of the module source code, the module has to be enabled by the Magento速 2 CLI.

    bin/magento module:enable Okaeli_CategoryCode

### System Upgrade

After enabling the module, the Magento速 2 system must be upgraded (here will the `okaeli_category_code` attribute be created).

If the system mode is set to production, run the compile command first. This is not necessary for the developer mode.

    bin/magento setup:di:compile

To upgrade the system, the upgrade command must be run.

    bin/magento setup:upgrade

### Clear Cache

At last, the Magento速 2 should be cleared by running the flush command.

    bin/magento cache:flush

Sometimes, other cache systems or services must be restarted first, e.g. Apache Webserver and PHP FPM.
Sometimes, you will have to run the following command too :

    bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f



## Usage

### Features

1. If you have to load a specific category, you should use the `Okaeli\CategoryCode\Helper\Data::getCategoryByCode` method.
As the code is unique and does not depend on the environment, you are sure to retrieve the wanted category. This would not be the case if 
you were using the `id` or even worse, the `name` ...

2. If you need to update layout of a category and do not want to do it in the backend, you should use the handle
`catalog_category_code_here_the_code_of_the_category`

For example, suppose that you need to remove the title of the category page **only** for the category having the code `modify_me`.
Then, you could create a `catalog_category_code_modify_me.xml` in the `app/design/frontend/MyCompany/MyTheme/Magento_Catalog/layout` folder with the following content :

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <page xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:View/Layout/etc/page_configuration.xsd">
        <body>
            <referenceBlock name="page.main.title" remove="true"/>
        </body>
    </page>


### Configurations

This module comes with one configuration :

  * `Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Storefront > Add category code handle`

  This configuration allows you to enable / disable frontend layout update. If `Yes` is selected,
a new handle depending on the category code (e.g `catalog_category_code_` concatenated with the category code in lowercase)

## Technical Notes

### No rewrite. Events driven development.

This extension is **0 rewrite**  guaranteed. The following event is listened:

  * `layout_load_before` : used to add custom handle in layout.
